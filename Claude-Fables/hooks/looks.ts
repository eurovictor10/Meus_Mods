/**
 * Graphic styles ("looks") a scene can be drawn in: the original look, its
 * pixel art, and the art styles of the Claude Mascot Style Gallery
 * (github.com/henrik-thevibe/Claude-Mascot-Style-Gallery).
 *
 * A look never changes what a scene is, only how it is drawn. The original
 * look is the lit scenery as authored; its pixel art pixelizes the whole stage.
 * Each gallery style is an artwork of its own (styles/*.ts): every element of
 * the scenery and Claude himself redrawn in its medium, with its own texture,
 * frame, chapter tag and caption bubble. A style made on a grid (tesserae,
 * a loom) also names that grid as its medium.
